It currently supports the GNU Radio Live DVD 3.7.9.1
See https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/GNURadioLiveDVD

INSTALL
=======

In order to use the LIVE DVD, a mounted/writable filesystem is needed.  The script
  mounts this to /usr/local/var to do its work.  This may be a place in your home
  directory or /tmp if you have enough memory in your computer or gave your VM.
  By default, the script will use $HOME/var and link it to /usr/local/var

See Makefile for details.

To go just:

make

or

sudo ./setup.sh

If you have everything setup the way you like it.
