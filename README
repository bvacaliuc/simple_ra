These are extra scripts to help with using 'simple_ra' on various Linux distros.

It currently supports the GNU Radio Live DVD 3.7.9.1
See https://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/GNURadioLiveDVD

INSTALL
=======

In order to use the LIVE DVD, a mounted/writable filesystem is needed.  The script
  uses $HOME/var to do its work.  If this doesn't have enough space (about 65M)
  then edit setup.sh to pick a different location.

See Makefile for details.

To go just:

make

or

sudo ./setup.sh

If you have everything setup the way you like it.
